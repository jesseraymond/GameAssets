Danger is My Middle Name is an action/adventure puzzle game with collect-a-thon elements, and is a love letter to the spy and spy parody genres, most particularly James Bond and Get Smart, and pop culture in general.

Taking place in the late 1980s, we follow the Secret Agent Division (SAD)’s top Secret Agent and utter buffoon, Dash “Danger” Cunningham, and his talented associates from around the world as they work together to thwart the Sinister People’s Extreme Collusion of Terrorists, Archvillains, Criminals, Lunatics and Eccentrics (SPECTACLE), and their ridiculous plan to take over the world or destroy it in the process. By using his skills (which he has few of), his wits (which he has even fewer of), his charm (which he has virtually none of), a lot of help from his team and heaps of dumb luck, Agent Danger must figure out what SPECTACLE's "Operation Grand Plan" is and how to stop it in this quirky, nostalgic and comedic globetrotting race to save the world, with stops in fictionalized versions of locations like the US Capitol, Atlantic City, Fort Knox, Cuba, The Swiss Alps, Japan, the South Pole and Earth's Orbit.

With a retro games-inspired, cute and endearing 3D cartoon style, Danger is My Middle Name offers a varied gameplay experience by weaving minigames inspired by popular classic games, toys and puzzles throughout the story and via a minigame gallery. The replay value is excellent, thanks to the inclusion of Free Play Mode which allows players to go back to previously completed levels using all of their unlocked characters freely in an effort to find numerous collectibles and other hidden secrets in areas that aren't normally accessible in Story Mode.

Story mode offers 6 playable characters and up to 10 additional characters unlockable for use in Free Play, all using distinct, diverse and inclusive character designs. In Story Mode, Agent Danger is playable in all levels and, while solo occasionally, he is joined in most levels by teammates including fellow SAD Agents, like the jet-pack wearing Agent Angel and freeze ray wielding Agent Icebox; Carnaval, the fabulous mercenary and entertainer; Nanya Bznebić AKA "The Barking Spider," the silent-but-deadly foreign intelligence operative; and the 9-year-old prodigy and key operational asset, Nao Yuudai. SPECTACLE forces are a veritable "who's that" of a spy parody rogue's gallery, including the flamboyant, megalomaniacal SPECTACLE leader with a Napolean complex, Blohard; the elderly veteran officer, Gums, who's been pulled out of retirement to go undercover as Danger's landlord; Brassknuckle, the SAD defector with an inarticulate, super-strong metal arm; his deadly and diminutive valet, Strangeduty; and Cat Saplenti, the eccentric and aptly-named cat burglar.

In terms of gameplay, Danger is My Middle Name is most heavily inspired by the Lego franchise games from TT Games (especially the Batman, Marvel or Star Wars titles), and Ron Gilbert's point-and-click adventure games like the Monkey Island franchise, Maniac Mansion/Day of The Tentacle and Thimbleweed Park. The games in both of those groupings offer comedy, puzzles and engrossing gameplay that keep you coming back game after game, even if the innovation between games in minimal. The relationship between Story Mode and Free Play, optional collect-a-thon objectives, hero roster driven puzzle/level design, and the 3D cartoon style are heavily inspired by Lego games, while the inventory, dialog and environmental interactions are loosely based on the Ron Gilbert classics, but modernized, streamlined and sped up to match the pace of an action/adventure game rather than the traditionally slower pace of point-and-click adventures.
